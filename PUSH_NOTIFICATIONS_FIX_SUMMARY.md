# Push Notifications Fix Summary

## üéØ Problem Identified

Your friend request push notifications weren't being delivered due to **two critical issues**:

### 1. üî¥ **Notification Channel ID Mismatch** (PRIMARY ISSUE)

**What was wrong:**
- **Backend** (`backend/src/config/firebase.ts`): Using channel ID `friend_activities`
- **Android App** (`FirebaseMessagingService.kt`): Expecting channel ID `friend_activity_channel`

**Why it matters:**
Android requires notifications to be sent to a specific "notification channel" that the app has created. When the backend sends a notification with a channel ID that doesn't exist in the app, Android silently drops the notification.

**Fix Applied:**
‚úÖ Updated `backend/src/config/firebase.ts` to use `friend_activity_channel` (matching the Android app)

---

### 2. üü° **Missing POST_NOTIFICATIONS Permission** (Android 13+ Only)

**What was wrong:**
Android 13 (API level 33) and above require apps to explicitly request the `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission at runtime, similar to location or camera permissions.

**Fix Applied:**
‚úÖ Added `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />` to `AndroidManifest.xml`

**Note:** You may need to request this permission at runtime. The app currently doesn't prompt the user for notification permissions.

---

## ‚úÖ Verified Configurations

1. **Firebase Admin SDK**: ‚úÖ Installed and initialized correctly
2. **Firebase Project**: ‚úÖ Backend and Android app both use `cpen-321-900e0`
3. **Service Account**: ‚úÖ Valid credentials in `backend/firebase.json`
4. **FCM Token Endpoint**: ‚úÖ Backend has `PUT /users/me/fcm-token` endpoint
5. **Token Registration**: ‚úÖ Android app registers FCM tokens via `FCMTokenManager`
6. **Notification Service**: ‚úÖ `PushNotificationService` properly configured in `AndroidManifest.xml`

---

## üöÄ What to Do Next

### Step 1: Restart Backend
The channel ID change requires restarting your backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test Notifications
Follow the detailed testing guide in `backend/TEST_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS.md`

**Quick Test:**
1. Login on two devices (Device A and Device B)
2. On Device A: Send friend request to user on Device B
3. Device B should receive notification: "New Friend Request from [User A]"

### Step 3: Check Logs

**Backend logs should show:**
```
üì± FCM token updated for user [name]
üì≤ Sent friend request notification to [name]
Successfully sent message: [message-id]
```

**Android logs should show:**
```
üî• New FCM token received: [token]
üî• FCM token successfully sent to backend
üî• Push notification received from: [sender]
```

## üìã Files Changed

### Backend
1. **`backend/src/config/firebase.ts`**
   - Changed `channelId: 'friend_activities'` ‚Üí `'friend_activity_channel'` (2 occurrences)

### Frontend
2. **`frontend/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
   - Added `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />`

### Documentation
3. **`backend/TEST_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS.md`** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive testing guide
4. **`PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_FIX_SUMMARY.md`** (NEW)
   - This summary document

## üîç How the System Works

### Registration Flow:
```
1. User opens app
2. Firebase generates FCM token
3. FCMTokenManager.registerFCMToken() called
4. Token sent to backend: PUT /users/me/fcm-token
5. Backend saves token in User.fcmToken field
```

### Notification Flow:
```
1. User A sends friend request to User B
2. Backend creates friendship record
3. notificationService.sendFriendRequestNotification() called
4. Backend fetches User B's FCM token
5. Firebase Admin SDK sends notification with:
   - token: User B's FCM token
   - title: "New Friend Request"
   - body: "[User A] sent you a friend request"
   - channelId: "friend_activity_channel" ‚úÖ (FIXED!)
6. Android system delivers notification to User B's device
7. PushNotificationService.onMessageReceived() handles it
8. Notification displayed in system tray
```

## üêõ If Notifications Still Don't Work

### Check 1: FCM Token Present in Database
```javascript
// In MongoDB
db.users.findOne({ email: "user@example.com" }, { fcmToken: 1, name: 1 })
```
Should return: `{ name: "...", fcmToken: "..." }`

If `fcmToken` is `null`:
- Token registration failed
- Check Android logs for `‚ùå Failed to register FCM token`
- Verify backend endpoint is reachable

### Check 2: POST_NOTIFICATIONS Permission (Android 13+)
The app may need to explicitly request this permission at runtime. Add this to your login screen or main activity:

```kotlin
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU) {
    if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS) 
        != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, 
            arrayOf(Manifest.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS), 100)
    }
}
```

### Check 3: Backend Errors
Look for these in backend logs:
- `‚ùå Failed to initialize Firebase` ‚Üí Check `firebase.json` file
- `No FCM token for user` ‚Üí Token not registered (see Check 1)
- `Error sending notification` ‚Üí Firebase service account issue

### Check 4: Test with Firebase Console
Send a test message from Firebase Console to verify device connectivity:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project `cpen-321-900e0`
3. Cloud Messaging ‚Üí Send test message
4. Enter your FCM token (from logs)
5. Send

If test message works ‚Üí Backend issue
If test message fails ‚Üí Device/app configuration issue

## üìä Expected Results

After fixes are applied:

| Scenario | Expected Result | Status |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| User logs in | FCM token registered | ‚úÖ Should work |
| Friend request sent | Receiver gets notification | ‚úÖ Should work now |
| Friend request accepted | Sender gets notification | ‚úÖ Should work now |
| Notification tapped | App opens | ‚úÖ Already works |
| Background notification | Still appears | ‚úÖ Should work |
| Killed app notification | Still appears | ‚úÖ Should work |

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:

1. **Backend logs:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Firebase Admin SDK initialized with service account
   üì± FCM token updated for user [name]
   üì≤ Sent friend request notification to [name]
   Successfully sent message: projects/cpen-321-900e0/messages/[id]
   ```

2. **Android logs:**
   ```
   üî• Firebase Messaging Service created
   üî• New FCM token received: [token]
   üî• FCM token successfully sent to backend
   üî• Push notification received from: [sender]
   üî• Notification displayed: New Friend Request - [User] sent you a friend request
   ```

3. **On device:**
   - Notification appears in system tray
   - Sound/vibration (if enabled)
   - Notification persists until dismissed
   - Tapping opens the app

## üîß Additional Improvements (Optional)

Consider implementing these enhancements:

### 1. Runtime Permission Request
Add notification permission prompt in `AuthViewModel` or `MainScreen`:
```kotlin
@Composable
fun RequestNotificationPermission() {
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU) {
        val notificationPermission = rememberPermissionState(
            android.Manifest.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS
        )
        
        LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
            if (!notificationPermission.status.isGranted) {
                notificationPermission.launchPermissionRequest()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Notification Actions
Add quick actions to notifications (Accept/Decline):
```kotlin
// In PushNotificationService.kt
val acceptIntent = Intent(this, AcceptFriendRequestActivity::class.java)
val acceptPendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(...)

val declineIntent = Intent(this, DeclineFriendRequestActivity::class.java)
val declinePendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(...)

val notification = NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
    // ... existing code ...
    .addAction(R.drawable.ic_check, "Accept", acceptPendingIntent)
    .addAction(R.drawable.ic_close, "Decline", declinePendingIntent)
    .build()
```

### 3. Rich Notifications
Add user profile picture to notifications:
```kotlin
// Load user image from URL and set as large icon
val bitmap = loadImageFromUrl(userProfilePictureUrl)
notificationBuilder.setLargeIcon(bitmap)
```

### 4. Notification Grouping
Group multiple friend requests:
```kotlin
notificationBuilder
    .setGroup("friend_requests")
    .setGroupSummary(true)
```

## üìù Notes

- The channel ID mismatch was the primary cause of notifications not appearing
- Both issues (channel ID + permission) needed to be fixed for full functionality
- The fixes are backward compatible (won't break older Android versions)
- Testing on physical devices is recommended (emulators may have FCM issues)

---

## üÜò Need More Help?

If notifications still don't work after these fixes:

1. Share backend logs (look for FCM-related errors)
2. Share Android logcat output (filter for "FCM" or "Firebase")
3. Verify FCM token exists in database for the receiver
4. Check Firebase Console for any project-level issues
5. Verify device has internet connectivity
6. Check device notification settings (not blocked for your app)
