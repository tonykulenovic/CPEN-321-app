### 3.7 Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**  
   The app shall display map pins within **2 seconds** of opening the map and update pins during panning with minimal delay. Real-time features (voting, notifications) shall respond within **1 second**. Database queries are optimized with proper indexing on frequently accessed fields (category, location, user_id, status). This ensures a smooth and responsive experience for students navigating campus in real time.

2. **Scalability**  
   The backend shall support at least **500 concurrent student users** with responses delivered in **≤2 seconds**. The system uses pagination (20 pins per page) and TTL indexes for efficient data management. The system shall handle peak traffic (e.g., during class transitions or at lunchtime) without compromising usability.

3. **Security**  
   All sensitive student data (friend connections, badges, location history, privacy settings) shall be **encrypted in transit and at rest**. The system implements JWT authentication, input validation with Zod schemas, and comprehensive privacy controls for location sharing and profile visibility. All user input is sanitized and validated before processing.

4. **Reliability**  
   The system shall maintain **99% uptime** with graceful degradation when external services are unavailable. Critical features (authentication, pin viewing) shall remain functional even during partial system failures. Comprehensive error handling and logging are implemented throughout the application.

5. **Usability**  
   The app shall provide an intuitive user experience with Material Design 3 principles, real-time updates via Socket.io, and responsive design for mobile-first experience. New users shall be able to complete basic tasks (view pins, vote, report) within **30 seconds** of app installation.

6. **Privacy**  
   The system provides granular privacy controls allowing users to control profile visibility, location sharing precision, and friend request preferences. Location data includes TTL (Time To Live) for automatic cleanup, and all privacy settings are enforced throughout the application.

## 4. Designs Specification

### **4.1. Main Components**

1. **Authentication Service**

   - **Purpose**: Handles Google OAuth login for all users with credential management.
   - **Rationale**: Using Google OAuth avoids building a custom authentication system and leverages an external trusted identity provider.
   - **Interfaces**: 
     1. **Google OAuth Integration**
        - `GoogleUserInfo authenticateUser(String googleIdToken)` - Validates Google ID token and returns user information
        - `String generateJWT(String userId, String email)` - Creates JWT token for authenticated user
        - `boolean validateJWT(String token)` - Validates JWT token and returns authentication status
     2. **Credential Manager**
        - `void storeCredentials(String userId, String refreshToken)` - Stores user credentials securely
        - `String getRefreshToken(String userId)` - Retrieves stored refresh token for user
        - `void clearCredentials(String userId)` - Removes stored credentials on logout
     3. **JWT Token Service**
        - `String createAccessToken(String userId, String email, String role)` - Generates access token with user claims
        - `Claims verifyToken(String token)` - Verifies and decodes JWT token claims
        - `boolean isTokenExpired(String token)` - Checks if token has expired

2. **Pin Manager**

   - **Purpose**: Manages CRUD operations for pins (create, update, delete, view) with voting and reporting.
   - **Rationale**: Pins are the central content of the app, and isolating them in a component makes it easier to manage validation, reports, and updates.  
   - **Interfaces**: 
     1. **Pin CRUD Operations**
        - `Pin createPin(CreatePinRequest request, String userId)` - Creates new pin with validation
        - `Pin getPinById(String pinId)` - Retrieves pin details by ID
        - `Pin updatePin(String pinId, UpdatePinRequest request, String userId)` - Updates existing pin
        - `boolean deletePin(String pinId, String userId)` - Deletes pin (owner or admin only)
        - `List<Pin> searchPins(SearchFilters filters)` - Searches pins with filtering and pagination
     2. **Voting System**
        - `VoteResult votePin(String pinId, String userId, VoteType voteType)` - Records user vote (upvote/downvote)
        - `boolean hasUserVoted(String pinId, String userId)` - Checks if user has already voted
        - `PinRating getPinRating(String pinId)` - Gets current vote counts and rating
     3. **Reporting System**
        - `boolean reportPin(String pinId, String userId, String reason)` - Reports pin for moderation
        - `List<ReportedPin> getReportedPins()` - Gets all reported pins (admin only)
        - `boolean moderatePin(String pinId, ModerationAction action)` - Takes moderation action (admin only)
     4. **Category Filtering**
        - `List<Pin> getPinsByCategory(PinCategory category)` - Filters pins by category
        - `List<Pin> getPinsByCategories(List<PinCategory> categories)` - Filters by multiple categories
     5. **Enhanced Metadata**
        - `PinMetadata getPinMetadata(String pinId)` - Gets capacity, crowd level, opening hours
        - `boolean updatePinMetadata(String pinId, PinMetadata metadata)` - Updates pin metadata

3. **User Management Service**

   - **Purpose**: Manages user profiles, privacy settings, and account operations.
   - **Rationale**: Centralized user management ensures consistent privacy controls and profile management across the app.
   - **Interfaces**:
     1. **Profile Management**
        - `User createUserProfile(GoogleUserInfo googleUser)` - Creates new user profile from Google OAuth
        - `User getUserProfile(String userId)` - Retrieves user profile information
        - `User updateUserProfile(String userId, UpdateProfileRequest request)` - Updates user profile

### **4.7. Design of Non-Functional Requirements**

#### **Current Implementation (Implemented)**

1. **Performance Requirements**

   - **Implementation**: Database queries are optimized using MongoDB compound indexes on frequently accessed fields (user_id, pin_category, location coordinates, status, visibility) with text search indexes on pin names and descriptions. Pagination is implemented with a default limit of 20 pins per page and skip-based pagination for efficient data retrieval. TTL indexes automatically clean up expired location data after 30 days, and regex-based text search provides fast filtering without full-text search overhead.

2. **Security Requirements**

   - **Implementation**: JWT tokens are generated with 24-hour expiration and include user ID, email, and role claims for stateless authentication. All API endpoints use Zod schemas for request validation and sanitization, preventing injection attacks and ensuring data integrity. Privacy controls are enforced at the service layer with granular permission checks for location sharing (off/live/approximate) and profile visibility (friends/everyone/private). Admin functions require role-based authorization middleware that validates admin status before allowing access.

3. **Reliability Requirements**

   - **Implementation**: All controller methods include try-catch blocks with specific error handling for network timeouts, database connection failures, and external API errors. The system gracefully degrades by returning cached data or default values when external services (Google Places, Firebase) are unavailable. Comprehensive logging is implemented using Winston logger with different log levels (info, warn, error) and structured logging for debugging and monitoring system health.

4. **Usability Requirements**
   - **Implementation**: The Android app uses Material Design 3 components with consistent theming, typography, and color schemes throughout all screens. Real-time updates are implemented using Socket.io for live location sharing, pin updates, and friend request notifications. Progressive loading is achieved with skeleton screens and loading states, while the responsive design uses Jetpack Compose's adaptive layouts for different screen sizes and orientations.

#### **Future Enhancements (Planned)**

1. **Advanced Performance**

     - Database sharding by geographic regions
     - Microservices architecture for independent scaling
     - Redis caching for session management

3. **Advanced Security**

   - **Planned**:
     - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
     - Advanced monitoring and alerting
     - Enhanced backup and recovery strategies

4. **Enhanced Usability**
   - **Planned**:
